connectionSecurity.display=Connection security
connectionSecurity.help=Method to use to secure connection to the LDAP server. Values: "ssl", "starttls"

sslProtocol.display=SSL protocol
sslProtocol.help=The standard name of the SSL protocol. This name is used to instantiate javax.net.ssl.SSLContext. See the SSLContext section in the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. E.g. SSL, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2

enabledSecurityProtocols.display=Enabled security protocols
enabledSecurityProtocols.help=Set of security protocols that are acceptable for protocol negotiation. This name is used to set up SSLEngine. See the SSLContext section in the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. E.g. SSL, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2

enabledCipherSuites.display=Enabled cipher suites
enabledCipherSuites.help=

authenticationType.display=Authentication type
authenticationType.help=The authentication mechanism to use. Values: "simple", "SASL-GSSAPI"

bindDn.display=Bind DN
bindDn.help=The DN to use when binding to the LDAP server

bindPassword.display=Bind password
bindPassword.help=Password to use when binding to the LDAP server

connectTimeout.display=Connect timeout
connectTimeout.help=Timeout for LDAP server connection (in milliseconds)

maximumNumberOfAttempts.display=Maximum number of attempts
maximumNumberOfAttempts.help=Maximum number of attempts to retrieve the entry or to re-try the operation. This number is applicable in replicated topology when handling connection failures and re-trying on another server, when following referrals and in similar situations.

baseContext.display=Base context
baseContext.help=The base DN used when no explicit base DN is specified

servers.display=Servers
servers.help=Structured definition of a server in the directory topology. It contains attribute-value pairs that define each individual server. The names of configuration properties can be used, separated by equal signs and semicolons, such as this: baseContext=dc=sub,dc=example,dc=com; host=sub.example.com; port=389  The server will be selected for each operation according to the baseContext that is specified in server definition. The most specific DN match will be used. If there are more multiple servers specified for the same baseContext then one of them will be selected randomly. The server which does not specify any baseContext is considered to be the default and that server will be used if the DN cannot be matched. This is equivalent to the server which is specified by ordinary configuration properties.  The configuration properties that are not explicitly specified in the server configuration line are taken from the ordinary configuration.

referralStrategy.display=Referral stratery
referralStrategy.help=Strategy of referral resolution. Values: "follow", "ignore", "throw"

passwordAttribute.display=Password attribute
passwordAttribute.help=Name of the LDAP attribute that is used to store account password

passwordHashAlgorithm.display=Password hash algorithm
passwordHashAlgorithm.help=Hash the passwords with a specified algorithm before they are sent to the server.

passwordReadStrategy.display=Password read strategy
passwordReadStrategy.help=Strategy for reading the password. LDAP schema itself cannot reliably indicate whether a password is readable or not. Therefore there this can be configured. Possible values: "unreadable": Password is not readable, it is never returned by the connector. This is the default. "incompleteRead": If password is returned by the LDAP server then connector will remove the value. Connector will indicate that the value is incomplete. Therefore IDM system can learn that there is password without knowing the password value. "readable": If password is returned by the LDAP server then it is passed to the IDM system in the same form as it was returned.

pagingStrategy.display=Paging strategy
pagingStrategy.help=Strategy used to send search requests that require paging. Usually specified preference over mechanisms such as VLV or simple paged results. Values: "none", "auto", "spr", "vlv"

pagingBlockSize.display=Paging block size

vlvSortOrderingRule.display=VLV ordering rule
vlvSortOrderingRule.help=LDAP ordering rule to use in VLV requests. Some LDAP servers require explicit specification of ordering rule.

uidAttribute.display=Primary identifier attribute
uidAttribute.help=Name of LDAP attribute to use as a primary identifier. This will be used as ConnId __UID__ attribute. The default is entryUUID which is the best choice for modern LDAP servers. Value of "dn" can be used here to use entry DN as a primary identifier.

operationalAttributes.display=Operational attributes
operationalAttributes.help=Names of significant LDAP operational attributes. Connector will try to return these attributes in each entry.

readSchema.display=Read schema
readSchema.help=If set to true (which is the default) then the connector will try to read LDAP schema.

schemaQuirksMode.display=Schema quirks mode
schemaQuirksMode.help=Some LDAP servers use strange or non-standard variations of schema definition. The quirks mode is used to tolerate these variations and use as much of the schema definition as possible.

allowUnknownAttributes.display=Allow unknown attributes
allowUnknownAttributes.help=Accept also attributes that are not defined in schema. Single-value string is assumed as the attribute type.

usePermissiveModify.display=Use permissive modify
usePermissiveModify.help=Use permissive modify LDAP control for modify operations. Possible values: "never", "auto", "always". Default value: auto

synchronizationStrategy.display=Synchronization strategy

baseContextsToSynchronize.display=Base contexts to synchronize
baseContextsToSynchronize.help=List of base contexts DNs that will be accepted during synchronization. If set to empty then all DNs will be accepted.

objectClassesToSynchronize.display=Object classes to synchronize
objectClassesToSynchronize.help=List of object classes that will be accepted during synchronization. If set to empty then all object classes will be accepted.

attributesToSynchronize.display=Attributes to synchronize

modifiersNamesToFilterOut.display=Modifiers names to filter out
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.help=List of modifiers DNs that will NOT be accepted during synchronization.

changeLogBlockSize.display=Changelog block size
changeLogBlockSize.help=Number of change log entries to fetch in a single request.

changeNumberAttribute.display=Change number attribute
changeNumberAttribute.help="Change number" attribute - unique indentifier of the change in the change log.

useUnsafeNameHint.display=Use unsafe name hint
useUnsafeNameHint.help=Entry DN can be provided to the connector as a "name hint". Connector will use the name hint whenever it can use it safely. But there are some cases when the name hint cannot be used safely. There are mostly modify and delete operations when in a rare case a wrong object can be modified or deleted. The connector will not use the name hint in these cases by default. It will make explicit search to make sure that everything is fair and square before attempting the operation. However this comes at the expense of performance. If this switch is set to true then the connector will try to use the name hint even if it is not completely safe. This may mean significant perfomacne boost for modify and delete operations.

enableExtraTests.display=Enable extra tests
enableExtraTests.help=Enable extra tests during the test connection operations. Those tests may take longer and they may make more LDAP requests. These tests try to test some tricky situations and border conditions and they are generally useful only for connector developers or when diagnosing connector bugs.

timestampPresentation.display=Timestamp presentation
timestampPresentation.help=Timestamp presentation mode. This controls the way how connector presents the timestamps to the client. It can present them as unix epoch (number of seconds since 1970) or the timestamps can be presented in LDAP-native string form (ISO 8601). Possible values: "unixEpoch", "string", default value: "unixEpoch"

includeObjectClassFilter.display=Include objectClass filter
includeObjectClassFilter.help=Enables inclusion of explicit object class filter in all searches. Normally the connector would derive search filter only based on the attributes specified in the query. E.g. (&(uid=foo)(cn=bar)). If includeObjectClassFilter is set to true, then also explicit filter for objectclass will be included. E.g (&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=foo)(cn=bar))

alternativeObjectClassDetection.display=Alternative object class detection
alternativeObjectClassDetection.help=Enabled more tolerant algorithm to detect which object class is structural and which is auxiliary.

additionalSearchFilter.display=Additional search filter
additionalSearchFilter.help=Search filter that will be added to all search operations that the connector does.

# LDAP

lockoutStrategy.display=Lockout strategy

globalCatalogStrategy.display=Global catalog strategy
globalCatalogStrategy.help=Strategy of global catalog usage. none: Do not use global catalog explicitly. The global catalog will only be used when following the referrals. resolve: The global catalog will be used to resolve DNs. Only the attributes that are stored in global catalog will be returned when object is retrieved. This provides incomplete data, but it avoids additional round-trip to an authoritative server. read:  The global catalog will be used to resolve DNs. Only the attribute that are stored in global catalog will be returned when object is retrieved. This provides incomplete data, but it avoids additional round-trip to an authoritative server.

allowBruteForceSearch.display=Allow brute force search
allowBruteForceSearch.help=If set to true then the connector will try to search all defined servers for an entry if all other attempts fail.

rawUserAccountControlAttribute.display=Raw userAccountControl
rawUserAccountControlAttribute.help=If set to false then the connector will interpret the content of userAccountControl attribute and will decompose it to pseudo-attributes for enabled state, lockout, etc. If set to true then the connector will NOT do any interpretation and the userAccountControl will be exposed as a simple attribute.

tweakSchema.display=Tweak schema
tweakSchema.help=Extend the declared AD schema with tweaks that allow practical usage of the schema. AD will generally allow any attribute to be set to any object regardless for the schema. This is often used is practice. E.g. declared AD schema for users and groups does not include samAccountName attribute. But that attribute is needed for users and groups to work correctly. If this configuration property is set to true (which is the default) then the connector will artificially add these attributes to the schema.

forcePasswordChangeAtNextLogon.display=Force password change at next log-on
forcePasswordChangeAtNextLogon.help=If set to true then the connector will force password change at next log-on every time when the password is changed. If set to false (default) the password change at next log-on will not be forced.
